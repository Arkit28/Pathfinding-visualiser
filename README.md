# Pathfinding-visualiser
An application which visualises the optimal path found by algorithms in a grid.

Expansion 1: Introduced a random maze generator. It applies recursive backtracking to find neighbouring cells which are not yet empty to convert the grid which in initialised with only walls. Increasing grid size to 25x25 allowing for more complex mazes to be generated too.

Expansion 2(TO BE COMPLETED): Dedicated maze solving algorithms: Hugging the wall, Random Mouse, Chain, Tremaux's 

To run, compile first.cpp using g++, then run the executable file in cmd.
